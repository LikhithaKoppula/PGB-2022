DAY 2



1. Write a program to create function calculation() such that it can accept two variables and calculate addition and subtraction. Also, it must return both addition and subtraction in a single return call.
2. Write a program to create a function show_employee() using the following conditions.
	a. It should accept the employeeâ€™s name and salary and display both.
	b. If the salary is missing in the function call then assign default value 9000 to salary
3. Create an inner function to calculate the addition in the following way
	a. Create an outer function that will accept two parameters, a and b
	b. Create an inner function inside an outer function that will calculate the addition of a and b
	c. At last, an outer function will add 5 into addition and return it
4. Write a program to create a recursive function to calculate the sum of numbers from 0 to 10.
5. Assign a different name to function and call it through the new name
	Ex: Below is the function display_student(name, age). Assign a new name show_tudent(name, age) to it and call it using the new name.
6. Find the largest item from a given list without using inbuilt methods
7. Convert string into a datetime object
