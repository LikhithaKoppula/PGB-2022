### Day -1 Assignment

Introduction to code versioning(Git) and basic git operation

1. Create git account
2. Install git client in your local system
3. Clone git repository in your local system 
4. Add java class with your name. Add print statement to main method.
5. Add your project folder to git repository
6. Commit your changes
7. Push your changes to remote repository


### Day -2 Assignment

1. Create a class - Take a meaningful class name - e.g. Employee, Country, Student, Birds, Animal and so on
2. Add attributes to class - Add Associated attribute to the class you chosen
3. Add Constructor to Class - Add default and parameterized constructor to class
4. Add getter and setter to Class variables
5. Override equals and hashCode method from object class
6. Add method in class for equality check of class Objects
7. Create two objects of class and do equality check with above method.
8. Showcase method overloading by creating the methods for the class created at step 1
9. Create a class with two functions one recursive and one non recursive. Either of these function should be
capable of calculating the factorial of a number.
10. Create another class to call the factorial methods of class created in step 12 and write the output.
11. Write a Generic class in java.
12. initialize generic class created in step 12 with different data type (For example with String and Integer type)
13. Add a method to the class that returns and print the data when called using generic class object.
14. Commit code to git repository

### Day -4 Assignment

1. Take input from console in your class method
2. Print the input taken from console. Reads a line of text and prints the integers in the line
3. Calculate the sum of integers taken at step 2.
4. Handle appropriate exceptions(Null pointer, Number format)
5. Add custom exception for your class structure.
6. Use the custom exception written in step 5 to the program written in step 3
7. Propagate the exception to main class.
8. Write a code to generate Runtime exception
9. Write a program to demonstrate the difference between Checked and UnChecked exception in java.
10. Identify a functional Interface in java library and implement it as lambda expression.
11. Write a Custom Functional Interface
12. Implement the method of functional interface as lambda expression.
13. Commit code to git repository
